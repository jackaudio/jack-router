This folder contains the sources for the ASIO/JACK bridge ASIO driver called
"JackRouter". The included project is a Visual Studio 10 one.

It requires the ASIO SDK to be installed in C:\Program Files\ASIOSDK and
assumes JACK is installed at the default location C:\Program Files\JACK2

The produced "JackRouter.dll" file has to be registered in the system using the
"regsvr32" tool. The same project can generate 32 and 64 bits binaries.

Starting v1.9.17 the Windows installer for JACK2 also installs the JackRouter
binaries.
